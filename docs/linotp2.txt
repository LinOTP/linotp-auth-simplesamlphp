LinOTP2 module
==============

This module provides a single authentication module for simpleSAMLphp to talk
to LinOTP2.

`linotp2:linotp2`
: Authenticate a user against a LinOTP2 server.

This module contacts the LinOTP2 server via the API
https://linotp2server/validate/check
and authenticates the user according to the token assigned to the user.

The response can also contain some attributes.

To enable this module, create a file 'enable' in the
directorpy 'modules/linotp/'.
Then you need to add the authentication source 'linotp2:linotp2' to
'config/authsources.php'. Do it like this:

    'example-linotp2' => array(
        'linotp2:linotp2',

        /*
         * The name of the LinOTP server and the protocol
	     * A port can be added by a :
         * Required.
         */
        'linotpserver' => 'https://your.server.com',

        /*
         * Check if the hostname matches the name in the certificate
         * Optional.
         */
        'sslverifyhost' => False,

        /*
         * Check if the certificate is valid, signed by a trusted CA
         * Optional.
         */
        'sslverifypeer' => False,

        /*
         * The realm where the user is located in.
         * Optional.
         */
        'realm' => '',

        /*
         * This is the translation from LinOTP attribute names to
         * SAML attribute names. If given, the LinOTP attribute name
         * will be renamed accordingly
         * Optional
         */
         'attributemap' => array(
         				'username' => 'samlLoginName',
         				'surname' => 'surName',
         				'givenname' => 'givenName',
         				'email' => 'emailAddress',
         				'phone' => 'telePhone',
         				'mobile' => 'mobilePhone',
         				),

    ),
